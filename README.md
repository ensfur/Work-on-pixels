# Work-on-pixels
A single-channel pixel structure is used to obtain a gray image. So how are color images obtained? It is displayed in color with a 3-channel pixel structure, which we call RGB. For example, you can use the RGB code (139, 69, 19) to get a brown image. What I have done in this study is to extract the brown color by using the primary colors and black.
[[B,G,R]
 [G,R,BL]
 [R,BL,BL]]
In the image I obtained with this sequence, only primary colors and black are used (R -> Red, G -> Green, B -> blue, BL -> Black). Ring problem occurred because compressions were applied for the images I uploaded. You can also get brown by using this sequence. In addition, if you look at the last image from far enough, you will see that it looks like brown.
Good work
